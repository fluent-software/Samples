Tetris Demo Game for nanoFramework
====================================

This was converted from an .net Micro Framework created on _(January 28th 2008)_

This was a demo application written to demonstrate different capabilities of .NET Micro Framework.
Windows Presentation Foundation, Extended Weak Reference for persistent storage etc.

It has been updated to work with nanoFramework (still Work in Progress).

This Tetris game became almost a benchmark demo for different hardware that supports .NET Micro Framework.
